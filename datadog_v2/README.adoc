= Redis Enterprise Datadog Integration

This directory contains resources for monitoring Redis Enterprise Software and Redis Cloud using Datadog. The integration uses Datadog's OpenMetrics integration to collect Prometheus metrics from Redis Enterprise clusters.

== Important Note

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Datadog integration for Redis Enterprise is not included in this repository. It is maintained separately in the official Datadog integrations repository at https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-integrations-extras under the `redis_enterprise_prometheus` integration.

Currently, you will need to use the Field Engineering branch at https://github.com/redis-field-engineering/datadog-integrations-extras/tree/redis_enterprise_prometheus to build and deploy the integration directly, as it is pending merger into the main Datadog repository.
====

== Requirements

To use this integration, you will need:

* A https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/[Redis Software] deployment or a https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/[Redis Cloud] account with a https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/subscriptions/create-flexible-subscription/[Flexible or Annual subscription]
* A https://www.datadoghq.com/[Datadog account] with API access
* A Datadog Agent deployment with the `redis_enterprise_prometheus` integration installed

=== Redis Enterprise Software

To monitor a Redis Enterprise Software deployment, you will need your cluster's FQDN or hostname. The Prometheus endpoint is available on port 8070 at the `/v2` path.

=== Redis Enterprise Cloud

To monitor a Redis Cloud deployment, you will need the https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/databases/view-edit-database/[private endpoint] for one of the databases associated with your Redis Cloud subscription.

This private endpoint will have the following form:
`redis-12345.internal.c67890.us-central1-1.gcp.cloud.rlrcp.com:121212`.

To get the Prometheus endpoint for your Redis Cloud subscription, drop the section before the first dot (in this case, the "redis-12345"), and specify the Prometheus exporter port 8070:
`internal.c67890.us-central1-1.gcp.cloud.rlrcp.com:8070`

== Installation

=== Building the Integration from Source

Since the integration is not yet available in the main Datadog repository, you'll need to build it from the Field Engineering branch:

1. Clone the Field Engineering fork:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/redis-field-engineering/datadog-integrations-extras.git
cd datadog-integrations-extras
git checkout redis_enterprise_prometheus
----

2. Navigate to the Redis Enterprise integration directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd redis_enterprise_prometheus
----

3. Build the integration wheel:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Install build dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Build the wheel
python setup.py bdist_wheel
----

4. Install the integration on your Datadog Agent:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Copy the wheel to your Datadog Agent host
# Install using the Datadog Agent's pip
sudo -u dd-agent /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install dist/datadog_redis_enterprise_prometheus-*.whl
----

5. Restart the Datadog Agent:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
----

== Configuration

=== Agent Configuration

Create a configuration file for the Redis Enterprise integration at `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/redis_enterprise_prometheus.d/conf.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
init_config:

instances:
  - openmetrics_endpoint: https://your-redis-cluster.example.com:8070/v2
    tls_verify: false
    type_overrides:
      endpoint_client_connections: gauge
----

=== Configuration Options

* `openmetrics_endpoint`: The Redis Enterprise Prometheus metrics endpoint (required)
* `tls_verify`: Set to `false` to skip TLS certificate verification (default: `true`)
* `type_overrides`: Override metric types as needed

=== Network Access Requirements

Ensure your Datadog Agent can reach:
* Redis Enterprise cluster on port 8070 (HTTPS)
* For Redis Cloud, ensure VPC peering or appropriate network connectivity

== Usage

=== Verifying the Integration

1. Check that the integration is loaded:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo datadog-agent status
----

2. Verify metrics are being collected:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo datadog-agent check redis_enterprise_prometheus
----

3. In the Datadog UI, search for metrics starting with `redis_enterprise_prometheus.*`

=== Available Metrics

The integration collects Redis Enterprise metrics including:
* Database metrics (connections, operations, memory usage)
* Node metrics (CPU, memory, network)
* Cluster metrics (shard distribution, replication)
* Proxy metrics (throughput, latency)

== Kickstarter

This repository includes a Terraform-based kickstarter to automate the deployment of the Datadog Agent with the Redis Enterprise integration. See the link:kickstarter/README.md[kickstarter README] for detailed instructions on using Terraform to deploy monitoring infrastructure on GCP.

The kickstarter handles:
* VM deployment with Datadog Agent
* Integration installation and configuration
* Network and security configuration
* Automated setup for Redis Enterprise monitoring
