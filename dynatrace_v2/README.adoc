= Observe Redis Enterprise with Dynatrace

To collect metrics in Dynatrace from Redis Enterprise Software or Redis Cloud,
use the https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/extensions20/extensions-concepts[Dynatrace Extensions 2.0 Framework].

== Installation

The Dynatrace v2.0 Extensions Framework supports Prometheus metrics, and as such we have created the necessary extension file and
dashboards so that this option is available. At this time Dynatrace are still testing their signing mechanism, so this
extension is not available directly from them but will have to be built and signed according to their instructions.
They have indicated that they will sign 3rd party extensions starting in Q1 2025, at which point this process will no
longer be necessary.

=== Setting Up the Dynatrace Extension

==== Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+ installed on your system
* A Dynatrace tenant
* An API token with permissions: `extensions.read`, `extensions.write`, `extensions.manage`, and `metrics.ingest`
* Redis Enterprise Software or Redis Cloud with metrics exporter enabled on port 8070

==== Step-by-Step Installation

1. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dt-cli:
+
[source,bash]
----
python -m venv dt-venv
source dt-venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: dt-venv\Scripts\activate
pip install dt-cli
----

2. Create certificates required for signing the extension:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Create a directory for certificates
mkdir -p secrets

# Generate a CA certificate
dt extension genca --no-ca-passphrase

# Generate a CA key
dt extension generate-developer-pem -o developer.pem --ca-crt ca.pem --ca-key ca.key  --name "Redis Developer"

# Move certificates to the secrets directory
mv ca.pem ca.key developer.pem developer.key secrets/
----

3. Assemble, sign, and upload the extension:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Assemble the extension
dt extension assemble

# Sign the extension with your developer certificate
dt extension sign --key secrets/developer.pem

# Upload the extension to your Dynatrace tenant
dt extension upload --tenant-url https://YOUR_TENANT_ID.live.dynatrace.com --api-token YOUR_API_TOKEN bundle.zip
----

4. *Important:* For remote monitoring, you need an ActiveGate or OneAgent. Install it by following the https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux[Dynatrace ActiveGate installation instructions].

5. Install your CA certificate on the ActiveGate:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Copy the CA certificate to ActiveGate
sudo cp secrets/ca.pem /var/lib/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/agent/conf/certificates/

# Restart ActiveGate to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart dynatracegateway
----

6. In your Dynatrace tenant:
   * Go to "Settings" â†’ "Extensions"
   * Find "Redis Enterprise Extension" and click "Activate"
   * Configure remote monitoring with your Redis endpoint: `https://YOUR_REDIS_SOFTWARE_ENDPOINT:8070/v2`

=== Terraform Automation for GCP

If you have an Active-Active Redis Enterprise deployment in GCP, you can use our Terraform scripts to automate the entire process. See the `terraform/gcp` directory for configuration details.

== Dashboards

This repository includes sample Dynatrace dashboards for monitoring your Redis deployment. See the
link:/src/dashboards[dashboards] folder for the available set of dashboards.
