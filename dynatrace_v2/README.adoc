= Observe Redis Enterprise with Dynatrace

To collect metrics in Dynatrace from Redis Enterprise Software or Redis Cloud,
use the https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/extensions20/extensions-concepts[Dynatrace Extensions 2.0 Framework].

== Installation

The Dynatrace v2.0 Extensions Framework supports Prometheus metrics, and as such we have created the necessary extension file and
dashboards so that this option is available. At this time Dynatrace are still testing their signing mechanism, so this
extension is not available directly from them but will have to be built and signed according to their instructions.
They have indicated that they will sign 3rd party extensions starting in Q1 2025, at which point this process will no
longer be necessary.

=== Setting Up the Dynatrace Extension

==== Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+ installed on your system
* A Dynatrace tenant
* An API token with permissions: `PaaS integration - Installer download`, `Write extension environment configurations`, `Read extension environment configurations`, `Write extension monitoring configurations`, `Read extension monitoring configurations`, `Write extensions`, `Read extensions`
* Redis Enterprise Software or Redis Cloud with metrics exporter enabled on port 8070

==== Step-by-Step Installation

1. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dt-cli:
+
[source,bash]
----
python -m venv dt-venv
source dt-venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: dt-venv\Scripts\activate
pip install dt-cli
----

2. Create certificates required for signing the extension:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Create a directory for certificates
mkdir -p secrets

# Generate a CA certificate
dt extension genca --no-ca-passphrase

# Generate a CA key
dt extension generate-developer-pem -o developer.pem --ca-crt ca.pem --ca-key ca.key  --name "Redis Developer"

# Move certificates to the secrets directory
mv ca.pem ca.key developer.pem developer.key secrets/
----

When You finish creating the ca.pem, ensure you upload it to your Dynatrace credentials vault by following these link:https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/extensions20/sign-extension#add-cert[instructions]

3. Assemble, sign, and upload the extension:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Assemble the extension
dt extension assemble

# Sign the extension with your developer certificate
dt extension sign --key secrets/developer.pem

# Upload the extension to your Dynatrace tenant
dt extension upload --tenant-url https://YOUR_TENANT_ID.live.dynatrace.com --api-token YOUR_API_TOKEN bundle.zip
----

4. *Important:* For remote monitoring, you need an ActiveGate or OneAgent. Install it by following the https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux[Dynatrace ActiveGate installation instructions].

5. Install your CA certificate on the ActiveGate:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Copy the CA certificate to ActiveGate
sudo cp secrets/ca.pem /var/lib/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/agent/conf/certificates/

# Restart ActiveGate to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart dynatracegateway
----

6. In your Dynatrace tenant:
   * Go to "Settings" â†’ "Extensions"
   * Find "Redis Enterprise Extension" and click "Activate"
   * Configure remote monitoring with your Redis endpoint: `https://YOUR_REDIS_SOFTWARE_ENDPOINT:8070/v2`

=== Terraform Automation for GCP

If you have an Active-Active Redis Enterprise deployment in GCP, you can use our Terraform scripts to automate the entire process. See the `terraform/gcp` directory for configuration details.

=== Kubernetes Deployments

**Important:** The Dynatrace Kubernetes operator is not compatible with the Extensions V2 framework. If you're running Redis Enterprise in Kubernetes, you have two alternative options:

==== Option 1: Kubernetes Service with Dynatrace Annotations

This approach creates a new service within your Kubernetes cluster with Dynatrace annotations for Prometheus scraping.

===== Prerequisites
* Dynatrace Kubernetes operator installed in your cluster
* Prometheus scraping enabled in Dynatrace Kubernetes settings

===== Steps

1. **Install Dynatrace Operator**
+
Follow the official Dynatrace operator installation guide:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Install Dynatrace operator according to Dynatrace documentation
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-operator/releases/latest/download/kubernetes.yaml
----

2. **Enable Prometheus Scraping in Dynatrace**
+
Configure Prometheus metric ingestion in your Dynatrace Kubernetes settings according to the official documentation:
https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/infrastructure-monitoring/container-platform-monitoring/kubernetes-monitoring/monitor-prometheus-metrics

3. **Create Annotated Service for Redis Metrics**
+
Apply the following service configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-metrics
  namespace: redis-enterprise
  annotations:
    metrics.dynatrace.com/scrape: "true"
    metrics.dynatrace.com/port: "8070"
    metrics.dynatrace.com/path: "/v2"
    metrics.dynatrace.com/secure: "true"
    metrics.dynatrace.com/insecure_skip_verify: "true"
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: redis-enterprise
    redis.io/role: node
    redis.io/cluster: redis-enterprise-cluster     # or whatever REC name in use
    redis.io/role-master: "1" # Point only at master node
  ports:
    - name: metrics
      port: 8070
      targetPort: 8070
----

4. **Verify Metrics Collection**
+
Check that Dynatrace is successfully scraping metrics from your Redis Enterprise deployment through the Kubernetes operator.

==== Option 2: External VM with ActiveGate

This approach involves deploying ActiveGate on a VM outside your Kubernetes cluster and exposing the Redis Enterprise metrics endpoint.

===== Prerequisites
* A VM outside your Kubernetes cluster with network access to the cluster
* ActiveGate installed on the VM
* Network connectivity between the ActiveGate VM and your Kubernetes cluster

===== Steps

1. **Deploy ActiveGate on External VM**
+
Follow the standard ActiveGate installation process on your VM:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Download and install ActiveGate according to Dynatrace documentation
# https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation
----

2. **Expose Redis Enterprise Metrics Service**
+
Create a NodePort service to expose the redis-enterprise-cluster-prom service:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-metrics-external
  namespace: redis-enterprise
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: redis-enterprise
    redis.io/role-master: "1"
  ports:
    - name: metrics
      port: 8070
      targetPort: 8070
      nodePort: 30070  # Choose an available port in the NodePort range
----

3. **Configure ActiveGate**
+
Configure your ActiveGate to scrape metrics from the exposed NodePort service using the external IP of your Kubernetes nodes and the NodePort (e.g., `https://KUBERNETES_NODE_IP:30070/v2`).

4. **Setup Extension**
+
Follow the standard extension setup process using the External VM's ActiveGate.
