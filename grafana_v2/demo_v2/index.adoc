= Redis Enterprise Developer Observability - Demonstrator
:revnumber: 1.1
:docinfo1:

== About the demonstrator

The demo was created so that it would encapsulate all the elements necessary to demonstrate a working Redis cluster, in
addition to a simple observability solution consisting of a Prometheus time-series database and a Grafana visualization
server accompanied by a set of standard dashboards.

The setup script 'setup.sh' will install containers for the different elements and configure their networking, after
which it cleans up any temporary files. Once the script has executed successfully the Grafana instance will be available
at localhost:3000 and Prometheus at localhost:9090, while the Redis console will be at localhost:8443. As these are the
default ports it is important that neither Redis nor Grafana nor Prometheus are already running on the machine.

The script loads dashboards from ./grafana_v2/dashboards/grafana_v9-11/software/basic by default, but it will load
dashboards from the directory passed as a parameter to the setup script thusly: setup.sh <dir>.

=== Viewing the demo

Grafana's default credentials are admin/admin. You will be asked to change the password after you have logged in
successfully. If you are planning on keeping this environment for any ongoing testing it is recommended that you change
the password. Prometheus has its own console that can be used to check the health of its source, in this case the Redis
cluster.

=== Loading some data

The demo includes a small script which can create data and load it into Redis in order to drive activity.
It is a python script, 'import/import.py', and as such it would require the Redis python client to be installed.
Alternatively one could use the memtier_benchmark found here: https://github.com/RedisLabs/memtier_benchmark
