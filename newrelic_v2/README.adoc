= Redis Enterprise New Relic Prometheus Exporter

This repository contains a set of New Relic dashboards configured to display Redis Enterprise v2 metrics exported through
Prometheus. For more details about the two versions as well as a guide to migrating between please see the following
link and, more specifically, its subsections: https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/prometheus-with-redis-enterprise/[Prometheus with Redis Enterprise]

== Requirements

To use this project, you will need:

* A https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/[Redis Enterprise] deployment or a https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/[Redis Cloud]
account with a https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/subscriptions/create-flexible-subscription/[Flexible or Annual subscription]
* A https://newrelic.com/[New Relic account]
* A Prometheus deployment. You can run Prometheus in a container using the provided Dockerfile, or you can configure an
existing Prometheus by referencing the included link:/prometheus.yml[prometheus.yml].

=== Redis Enterprise Software

To monitor a Redis Enterprise Software deployment, you will need your cluster"s FQDN or hostname. The Prometheus
endpoint is available on port 8070.

=== Redis Enterprise Cloud

To monitor a Redis Cloud deployment, you will need the
https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/databases/view-edit-database/[private endpoint] for one of the databases associated
with your Redis Cloud subscription.

This private endpoint will have the following form:

`redis-12345.internal.c67890.us-central1-1.gcp.cloud.rlrcp.com:121212`.

To get the Prometheus endpoint for your Redis Cloud subscription, drop the section before the first dot (in this case,
the "redis-12345"), and specify the Prometheus exporter port 8070:

`internal.c67890.us-central1-1.gcp.cloud.rlrcp.com:8070`

This is the endpoint that you will provide when you configure Prometheus.

== Usage

=== Configure Prometheus

From New Relic UI, find the left-hand menu and click "Add Data".

Type "Prometheus" in the search bar and then select "Prometheus Remote Write Integration".

Enter a name for the installation (e.g., "redis-server-prod") and click "generate". This will generate a remote write
configuration with a bearer token.

Open the sample link:./config/prometheus.yml[prometheus.yml] file and find the "remote_write" configuration directive.

Under "url", replace "REDIS_ENTERPRISE_SERVER_NAME" with the installation name you just provided when generating your
token (e.g., "redis-server-prod").

Next, find the "remote_write" -> "authorization" -> "credentials" configuration directive.
Replace NEW_RELIC_BEARER_TOKEN with the value of the bearer token you just generated.

Finally, find the "scrape_config" configuration directive where "job_name" is "redis-enterprise".
Under "static_configs", replace REDIS_ENTERPRISE_HOST with the FQDN or hostname of your Redis Enterprise deployment.

Redis reports hundreds of metrics, and depending on the size of your deployment this may require large amounts of storage.
In order to tailor the stored data to meet minimal requirements we have included an link:./config/except.txt[except file].
The contents of this file should be used in conjunction with an except clause:

```
transformations:
 - description: "General processing rules"
   ignore_metrics:
     - except:
       - kube_hpa_
```

See the documentation link:https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/ignore-or-include-prometheus-metrics/[here]
 if you have further questions.


=== Run a Prometheus Server using Docker

If you don't already have a Prometheus server, you can run Prometheus using a Docker container. This container will
forward Prometheus metrics from Redis Enterprise to New Relic.

For Redis Enterprise Cloud deployments, ensure that the VM running your Prometheus container is
https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/security/vpc-peering/:[VPC-peered with your Redis cluster"s VPC].

Next, use the included link:/Dockerfile[Dockerfile] to create a container image.

Build and tag the image:

[source,bash]
docker build -t new-relic-redis-cloud-prometheus .

Then run the image you just created:

[source,bash]
docker run \
    -d \
    --name prometheus-exporter \
    --network=host \
    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
    --privileged \
    --pid=host \
    --cgroupns=host
	new-relic-redis-cloud-prometheus

Now you can test that metrics are flowing correctly to New Relic.

Once the container has been running for five minutes, open the New Relic UI and click "Query Your Data" in the left-hand
menu. In the "Metric" search bar, enter "bdb_up", which should then appear in the results. You can then click to launch a
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/[NRQL query],
and this will return a value corresponding to the number of databases.

== Dashboards

This project includes sample New Relic dashboards that you can install to get you up and running quickly.
See the link:https://github.com/redis-field-engineering/redis-enterprise-observability/tree/main/newrelic/dashboards[dashboards] folder.

To install the dashboards in the New Relic console, click on the ""Dashboards"" link in the left menu,
and then click "Import Dashboard" in the top right. Open the dashboard that you wish to import in a text editor.
Copy the accountId from the New Relic URL after logging in, it looks like this:
`one.newrelic.com/dashboards?account=<#>&state`
And replace all occurrences of '1234567' in the dashboard file with this value. Then paste the contents of the JSON file
into the import text area.

Once you've installed the dashboards, open the Cluster Dashboard and select a cluster using the "cluster" dropdown menu.
If data is flowing correctly, you will see a set of charts with active data. If you cannot see any data, ensure that
the time range for the dashboards is set to the last 10 minutes (you can find this setting at the upper right-hand
corner of the UI).
